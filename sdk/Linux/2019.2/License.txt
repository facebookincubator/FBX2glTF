Autodesk® FBX® SDK 2019

READ CAREFULLY:  AUTODESK LICENSES THE SOFTWARE AND OTHER LICENSED MATERIALS ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT LICENSEE ACCEPTS ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED OR REFERENCED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
By selecting the “I accept” button or other button or mechanism designed to acknowledge agreement to the terms of an electronic copy of this Agreement, or by installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise copying or using all or any portion of the Autodesk Materials, (i) you accept this Agreement on behalf of the entity for which you are authorized to act (e.g., an employer) and acknowledge that such entity is legally bound by this Agreement (and you agree to act in a manner consistent with this Agreement) or, if there is no such entity for which you are authorized to act, you accept this Agreement on behalf of yourself as an individual and acknowledge that you are legally bound by this Agreement, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you have the right, power and authority to act on behalf of and bind such entity (if any) or yourself.  You may not accept this Agreement on behalf of another entity unless you are an employee or other agent of such other entity with the right, power and authority to act on behalf of such other entity.
If Licensee is unwilling to accept this Agreement, or you do not have the right, power and authority to act on behalf of and bind such entity or yourself as an individual (if there is no such entity), (a) DO NOT SELECT THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON OR OTHERWISE CLICK ON ANY BUTTON OR OTHER MECHANISM DESIGNED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AGREEMENT, AND DO NOT INSTALL, DOWNLOAD, ACCESS, OR OTHERWISE COPY OR USE ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE AUTODESK MATERIALS; AND (b) WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUIRING THE AUTODESK MATERIALS, LICENSEE MAY RETURN THE AUTODESK MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY COPIES) TO THE ENTITY FROM WHICH THEY WERE ACQUIRED FOR A REFUND OF THE APPLICABLE LICENSE FEES PAID BY THE LICENSEE.  
The words “Autodesk", “Agreement” and “Licensee” and other capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined terms.  The definitions can be found in Exhibit A (if the terms are not defined in the main body of the Agreement).
1.	License
1.1	License Grant.  Subject to and conditioned on Licensee’s continuous compliance with this Agreement, Autodesk grants Licensee a nonexclusive, nonsublicensable, nontransferable, limited license to Install and Access the Licensed SDK and User Documentation, in each case solely (a) in the Territory, (b) within the scope of the License Type and Permitted Number specified in the applicable License Identification, and (c) in accordance with the other terms of this Agreement, to:
1.1.1       (a)    use the SDK for development, research, internal, educational, or commercial purposes:
                (i) to create a software product with the capability to read and/or write and/or translate Licensee files, which software product links to the Library (“Developed Software”); and/or
                (ii) to modify the Sample Code(s) solely to create an object code version(s) (“Modified Code(s)”); and/or
        (b)     reproduce the Library to link to the Developed Software.
1.1.2      (a)     incorporate the executable version of the Developed Software into; and/or
        (b)     incorporate the Modified Code(s) into; and/or
        (c)     link the Library, in binary code form to;
software products developed by Licensee (“Licensee Product(s)”) for Licensee’s Internal Business Needs.
        1.1.3   reproduce, distribute and sublicense free of charge or for a fee Licensee Product(s) provided that Licensee must sublicense the Software, the Developed Software, the Library, the Sample Code(s) and the Modified Code(s) “as is”, without warranty of any kind.
Various License Types are described in Exhibit B.  In any case where the License Identification does not specify a License Type or Permitted Number or Territory, or there is no License Identification, the License Type will, by default, be the Stand-alone (Individual) License and the Territory will be worldwide, subject to the Export Control requirements herein.
        1.1.4       Licensee shall reproduce and apply any copyright or other proprietary rights notices included on or embedded in the Software, or any part thereof, to any copies of the Software or any part thereof, or to the Developed Software, in any form.
        1.1.5       Licensee shall place the following statement in the copyright area of either: (i) the end-user License and/or terms of use for the Developed Software; or (ii) the ‘About Box’ or similar notice page of the Developed Software; and Licensee shall also include the following statement in the copyright area of either: (a) the on-line documentation regarding the Developed Software; or (b) any other document related to Developed Software that contains copyright information:
“This software contains Autodesk® FBX® code developed by Autodesk, Inc. Copyright 2018 Autodesk, Inc. All rights, reserved. Such code is provided “as is” and Autodesk, Inc. disclaims any and all warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement of third party rights. In no event shall Autodesk, Inc. be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of such code.”
1.2	Upgrades and Previous Versions.  
        1.2.1	Effect of Upgrades.  If Autodesk or a Reseller provides Licensee with an Upgrade to other Licensed Materials previously licensed to Licensee, the Licensed Materials previously licensed to Licensee and any other Autodesk Materials relating thereto will thereafter be deemed to be a “Previous Version.”  Except as set forth in Section 1.2.2 (Exception for Relationship Program Licensees), the license grant and other rights with respect to any Previous Version will terminate one hundred twenty (120) days after Installation of the Upgrade.  Within such one hundred twenty (120) day period, except as set forth in Section 1.2.2 (Exception for Relationship Program Licensees), (a) Licensee must cease all use of any Previous Version and Uninstall all copies of the Previous Version, and (b) upon expiration of such period, such Previous Version will no longer constitute Licensed Materials but rather will be deemed to be Excluded Materials and Licensee will no longer have a license for any such Previous Version.  At Autodesk’s request, Licensee agrees to destroy or return to Autodesk or the Reseller from which they were acquired all copies of the Previous Version.  Autodesk reserves the right to require Licensee to show satisfactory proof that all copies of any Previous Version have been Uninstalled and, if so requested by Autodesk, destroyed or returned to Autodesk or the Reseller from which they were acquired.
        1.2.2	Exception for Relationship Program Licensees.  The termination of rights as to Previous Versions described in Section 1.2.1 (Effect of Upgrades) may not apply to Licensee if and to the extent (a) Licensee participates in a Relationship Program and the Relationship Program Terms authorize Licensee to retain such Previous Versions or (b) otherwise authorized in writing by Autodesk.
1.3	Additional Terms.  The Licensed Materials (or portions thereof) may be subject to terms (e.g., terms accompanying such Licensed Materials or made available in connection with ordering, installing, downloading, accessing, using or copying such Licensed Materials) that are in addition to or different from the terms set forth in this Agreement, and Licensee agrees to comply with such terms.
1.4	Other Materials.  If Autodesk provides or makes available to Licensee any additional materials associated with the Licensed Materials, including any corrections, patches, service packs, updates or upgrades to, or new versions of, the Licensed Materials (including Upgrades) or any Supplemental Materials or User Documentation for the Licensed Materials, (a) such additional materials may include or be subject to other terms in addition to or different from the terms set forth in this Agreement (including, without limitation, additional or different fees, license terms, or restrictions on use), and Licensee agrees to comply with such terms, or (b) if there are no other terms for such additional materials, they will (except as otherwise provided by Section 1.2 (Upgrades and Previous Versions)) be subject to the same terms (including, without limitation, the licenses, applicable License Type and Permitted Number, and other terms of this Agreement) as the Licensed Materials to which such additional materials apply.  In no event will the foregoing result in any rights with respect to Excluded Materials.
1.5	Authorized Users.  Licensee may permit the Licensed Materials to be Installed and/or Accessed only by Licensee’s Personnel (except as otherwise designated in the applicable License Type), and any such Installation or Access will be subject to any other requirements imposed by this Agreement and the applicable License Type and Permitted Number.  Licensee will be responsible for compliance with this Agreement by Licensee’s Personnel and any other persons who may have Access to the Autodesk Materials through Licensee (whether or not such Access is authorized by Autodesk or within the scope of the applicable License Type and Permitted Number).
1.6	Third-Party Licensed Materials.  The Autodesk Materials may contain or be accompanied by third-party software, data or other materials that are subject to and provided in accordance with terms that are in addition to or different from the terms set forth in this Agreement.  Such terms may be included or referenced in or with such third-party software, data or other materials (e.g., in the “About box”) or a web page specified by Autodesk (the URL for which may be obtained on Autodesk’s website or on request to Autodesk).  Licensee agrees to comply with such terms.  In addition, Licensee will take sole responsibility for obtaining and complying with any licenses that may be necessary to use third-party software, data or other materials that Licensee uses or obtains for use in conjunction with the Licensed Materials.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Autodesk has no responsibility for, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, such third-party software, data or other materials or Licensee’s use of such third-party software, data or other materials.
1.7	Relationship Programs.  Autodesk may offer to Licensee, and (if so) Licensee may participate in one (1) or more Relationship Programs applicable to the Licensed Materials licensed to Licensee under this Agreement (and such Relationship Programs may include rights in addition to or different from those set forth in this Agreement).  Any Relationship Programs are subject to Autodesk’s terms therefor, which terms are set forth in the applicable Relationship Program Terms.  Licensee agrees that if it requests, accepts, or makes use of any Relationship Program, Licensee will be bound by such terms, as they may be modified from time to time in accordance with the applicable Relationship Program Terms (and such terms, as so modified from time to time, are a part of and incorporated by reference into this Agreement), and Licensee agrees to comply with such terms.  Licensee acknowledges that Autodesk may require a further acceptance of such terms as a condition to participation in a Relationship Program.
1.8	Services.  Autodesk may provide, and Licensee may elect to receive or benefit from, certain Services from time to time.  Any Services are subject to Autodesk’s terms therefor, which terms are set forth in the applicable Services Terms.  Licensee agrees that if it requests, accepts, or makes use of any Services, Licensee will be bound by such terms, as they may be modified from time to time in accordance with the applicable Services Terms (and such terms, as so modified from time to time, are a part of and incorporated by reference into this Agreement), and Licensee agrees to comply with such terms.  Licensee acknowledges that Autodesk may require a further acceptance of such terms as a condition to providing Services.
1.9	Archival Copy.  Licensee’s license under Section 1.1 (License Grant) includes the right to make a single archival copy of the Licensed Materials in the Territory, provided that (a) the single-copy limitation will not apply to copies made as an incidental part of a routine backup of Licensee’s entire computer system on which the Licensed Materials are Installed in accordance with this Agreement, where such backup includes the making of copies of substantially all other software on such computer system and (b) any archival copy may be Accessed or Installed (other than on a backup storage medium from which the Licensed Materials cannot be Accessed) only when and for so long as the primary copy of the Licensed Materials is inaccessible and inoperable.  Copies of the Licensed Materials that are Installed and are in excess of the Permitted Number at any time while the primary copy of the Licensed Materials is also Accessible are not "archival copies" as permitted under this Section 1.9 (Archival Copy).
1.10	Nature of Licenses.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that when Licensee acquires a license of Licensed Materials, (including through a Relationship Program or Services), Licensee’s acquisition is neither contingent on the delivery of any future features or functionality nor subject to any public or other comments (oral, written or otherwise) made by Autodesk regarding future features or functionality.
1.11	Feedback.
Licensee hereby grants Autodesk, under all of Licensee’s intellectual property and proprietary rights, the following worldwide, exclusive, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up rights: (1) to make, have made, use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of the Feedback as part of or in connection with any Autodesk product, technology, service, content, material, specification or documentation (including without limitation in connection with the marketing or sale thereof); (2) to publicly perform or display, import, broadcast, transmit, distribute, license, offer to sell and sell, rent, lease or lend copies of the Feedback (and derivative works thereof and improvements thereon); and (3) to sublicense to third parties the foregoing rights, including the right to sublicense to further third parties.  “Feedback” shall mean all suggestions, comments, input, ideas, reports, information or know-how (whether in oral or written form) provided by Licensee to Autodesk or an Autodesk affiliate in connection with Licensee’s evaluation of or use of the Licensed Materials.  Feedback does not include any artwork or sample content created by Licensee using the Licensed Materials.
2.	License Limitations; Prohibitions
2.1	Limitations and Exclusions.
        2.1.1	No License Granted; Unauthorized Activities.  The parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no license is granted (whether expressly, by implication or otherwise) under this Agreement (and this Agreement expressly excludes any right) (a) to Excluded Materials, (b) to any Autodesk Materials that Licensee did not acquire lawfully or that Licensee acquired in violation of or in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, (c) for Installation of or Access to the Licensed Materials beyond the applicable license term (whether a fixed term or Relationship Program period or term) or outside the scope of the applicable License Type or Permitted Number, (d) for Installation of the Licensed Materials on any Computer other than a Computer owned or leased, and controlled, by Licensee, unless otherwise authorized in writing by Autodesk, (e) to distribute, rent, loan, lease, sell, sublicense, transfer or otherwise provide all or any portion of the Autodesk Materials to any person or entity except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or as expressly authorized in writing by Autodesk, (f) to provide or make available any features or functionality of the Autodesk Materials to any person or entity (other than to and for Licensee itself for the purpose specified in the applicable License Type), whether or not over a network and whether or not on a hosted basis, (g) except as otherwise expressly provided with respect to a specific License Type, to Install or Access or allow the Installation of or Access to the Autodesk Materials over the Internet or other non-local network, including, without limitation, use in connection with a wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), virtualization, Web hosting, time-sharing, service bureau, software as a service, cloud or other service or technology, (h) to remove, alter or obscure any proprietary notices, labels or marks in the Autodesk Materials, (i) to decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Autodesk Materials, or (j) to translate, adapt, arrange, or create derivative works based on, or otherwise modify the Autodesk Materials for any purpose.
        2.1.2	Licensed Materials as a Single Product.  The Licensed Materials are licensed to Licensee as a single product and the applicable components may not be separated for Installation or Access (and all such components must be Installed and Accessed on the same Computer except as authorized in writing by Autodesk).
        2.1.3	Territory.  Except as otherwise authorized in writing by Autodesk, the licenses granted in this Agreement are granted only for the Territory.  Nothing in this Agreement permits Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensee’s Personnel, if any) to Install or Access the Licensed Materials outside of the Territory.
        2.1.4	Effect of Unauthorized Use.  Licensee will not engage in, and will not permit or assist any third party to engage in any of the uses or activities prohibited (or any uses or activities inconsistent with the limitations described) in this Section 2.1 (Limitations and Exclusions) (collectively, “Unauthorized Uses”).  Any such Unauthorized Use, and any Installation of or Access to the Licensed Materials provided under this Agreement, outside of the scope of the applicable license grants (including, without limitation, outside the applicable License Type and/or Permitted Number) or otherwise not in accordance with this Agreement, constitute or result in infringement of Autodesk’s intellectual property rights as well as a breach of this Agreement.  Licensee will notify Autodesk promptly of any such Unauthorized Uses or other unauthorized Installation or Access.
        2.1.5	Use of Open Source Software by Licensee.  If Licensee uses any third party software (including free or Open Source Software), whether or not in conjunction with the Software, Licensee shall ensure that its use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of Autodesk or any of its affiliates with respect to the Software; (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under Autodesk’s or any of its affiliates intellectual property rights; or (iii) cause the Software to be subject to any licensing terms other than those set forth in this Agreement.
2.2	Circumvention.  
        2.2.1	Licensee may not (i) utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means to (or designed to) circumvent or remove any form of technical protection used by Autodesk in connection with the Autodesk Materials, or (ii) Install or Access the Autodesk Materials with any product code, authorization code, serial number, or other copy-protection device not supplied by Autodesk directly or through a Reseller.  Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, Licensee may not utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means to (or designed to) circumvent or remove the Autodesk License Manager or any tool or technical protection measure provided or made available by Autodesk for managing, monitoring or controlling Installation of or Access to Autodesk Materials.
        2.2.2	Licensee may not utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means to (or designed to) circumvent or remove any usage restrictions, or to enable functionality disabled by Autodesk, in connection with the Excluded Materials.  Licensee may not bypass or delete any functionality or technical limitations of the Autodesk Materials that (or that are designed to) prevent or inhibit the unauthorized copying of, Installation or Access to the Excluded Materials.
3.	All Rights Reserved
Autodesk and its licensors retain title to and ownership of, and all other rights with respect to, the Autodesk Materials and all copies thereof, including, without limitation, any related copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights.  Licensee has only the limited licenses granted with respect to the Licensed Materials expressly set forth in this Agreement, and Licensee has no other rights, implied or otherwise.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the Autodesk Materials are licensed, not sold, and that rights to Install and Access the Licensed Materials are acquired only under the license from Autodesk.  The structure and organization of Software included in the Autodesk Materials, any source code or similar materials relating to such Software, any API Information and Development Materials (both as described in Section 1.11 (APIs)), and any other Licensed Materials identified as confidential or proprietary are valuable trade secrets of, and confidential and proprietary information of, Autodesk and its suppliers, and (a) may not be distributed, disclosed or otherwise provided to third parties, and (b) may be used only internally and only in conjunction with and for Licensee’s own authorized internal use of the Licensed Materials.  
4.	Privacy; Use of Information; Connectivity
4.1	Privacy and Use of Information.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee (and third parties acting on Licensee’s behalf) may provide, and Autodesk and its Resellers (and third parties acting on behalf of Autodesk and its Resellers) may obtain, certain information and data with respect to Licensee (including, without limitation, personal information) and Licensee’s business in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, information and data provided to or obtained by Autodesk and its Resellers (or third parties acting on behalf of Autodesk and its Resellers) through the Customer Information Form and otherwise, in connection with ordering, registration, activation, updating, validating entitlement to, auditing, monitoring Installation of and Access to Autodesk Materials, Relationship Programs and Services and managing the relationship with Licensee.  Licensee hereby consents to Autodesk maintaining, using, storing and disclosing such information and data (including, without limitation, personal information, if any) in conformity with Autodesk’s policies on privacy and data protection, as such policies may be updated from time to time, including without limitation Autodesk’s Privacy Statement, as currently located at http://usa.autodesk.com/privacy/.  Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, Licensee acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Autodesk may from time to time prompt Licensee (and third parties acting on Licensee’s behalf) to provide express agreement to the terms of Autodesk’s Privacy Statement and/or express agreement to specific uses of information and data (including, without limitation, personal information); (b) Autodesk may provide information and data, including, without limitation, information and data about Licensee’s use of Autodesk Materials, Relationship Programs, and Licensee’s support requests, to Autodesk subsidiaries and affiliates, Resellers and other third parties in connection with the provision, maintenance, administration or usage of Licensed Materials, Relationship Programs or Services or in connection with enforcement of any agreements relating to Licensed Materials, Relationship Programs or Services; and (c) Autodesk may make cross-border transfers of such information and data, including to jurisdictions with privacy or data protection laws that are less protective of Licensee than the jurisdiction in which Licensee is domiciled.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that such policies may be changed from time to time by Autodesk and that, effective upon posting on Autodesk’s website or other written notice from Autodesk, Licensee will be subject to such changes.  
4.2	Connectivity.  Certain Licensed Materials may facilitate or require Licensee’s access to and use of content and services that are hosted on websites maintained by Autodesk or by third parties.  In some cases, such content and services may appear to be a feature or function within, or extension of, the Licensed Materials on Licensee’s Computer even though hosted on such websites.  Accessing such content or services and use of Licensed Materials may cause Licensee’s Computer, without additional notice, to connect automatically to the Internet (transitorily, intermittently or on a regular basis) and to communicate with an Autodesk or third-party website—for example, for purposes of providing Licensee with additional information, features and functionality or to validate that the Licensed Materials and/or content or services are being used as permitted under this Agreement or other applicable terms.  Such connectivity to Autodesk websites is governed by Autodesk’s policies on privacy and data protection described in this Section 4 (Privacy; Use of Information; Connectivity).  Such connectivity to websites of third parties is governed by the terms (including the disclaimers and notices) found on such sites or otherwise associated with the third-party content or services.  Autodesk does not control, endorse, or accept responsibility for any such third-party content or services, and any dealings between Licensee and any third party in connection with such content or services, including, without limitation, such third party’s privacy policies, use of personal information, delivery of and payment for goods and services, and any other terms associated with such dealings, are solely between Licensee and such third party.  Autodesk may at any time, for any reason, modify or discontinue the availability of any third-party content or services. Access to and use of certain content and services (whether of Autodesk or third parties) may require assent to separate terms and/or payment of additional fees.
5.	Limited Warranty and Disclaimers 
5.1	Limited Warranty.  Autodesk warrants that, as of the date on which the Licensed Materials are delivered to Licensee and for ninety (90) days thereafter or if the license term is shorter, such shorter period (“Warranty Period”), the Licensed Materials will provide the general features and functions described in the User Documentation portion of the Licensed Materials.  Autodesk's entire liability and Licensee’s exclusive remedy during the Warranty Period (“Limited Warranty”) will be, with the exception of any statutory warranty or remedy that cannot be excluded or limited under law, at Autodesk's option, (i) to attempt to correct or work around errors, if any, or (ii) to refund the license fees, if any, paid by Licensee and terminate this Agreement or the license specific to such Licensed Materials.  Such refund is subject to the return, during the Warranty Period, of the Autodesk Materials, with a copy of Licensee’s License Identification, to Licensee’s local Autodesk office or the Reseller from which Licensee acquired the Autodesk Materials.  THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION GIVES LICENSEE SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS.  LICENSEE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER LAW WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.  AUTODESK DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT LICENSEE’S WARRANTY RIGHTS TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW.
5.2	Disclaimer.  EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY PROVIDED IN SECTION 5.1 (LIMITED WARRANTY), AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AUTODESK AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE, AND LICENSEE RECEIVES, NO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT, OR WARRANTIES OTHERWISE IMPLIED BY STATUTE OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE) WITH RESPECT TO ANY AUTODESK MATERIALS, RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS, OR SERVICES (PURSUANT TO A RELATIONSHIP PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE).  ANY STATEMENTS OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE AUTODESK MATERIALS, RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS OR SERVICES AND THEIR FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY IN THE LICENSED MATERIALS OR ANY COMMUNICATION WITH LICENSEE ARE FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE A WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, OR CONDITION.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AUTODESK DOES NOT WARRANT:  (a) THAT THE OPERATION OR OUTPUT OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR COMPLETE, WHETHER OR NOT UNDER A RELATIONSHIP PROGRAM OR SUPPORT BY AUTODESK OR ANY THIRD PARTY; (b) THAT ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED BY AUTODESK OR ANY THIRD PARTY; OR (c) THAT AUTODESK OR ANY THIRD PARTY WILL RESOLVE ANY PARTICULAR SUPPORT REQUEST OR THAT SUCH RESOLUTION WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS.  NOTHING IN THE FOREGOING RESTRICTS THE EFFECT OF WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHICH MAY BE IMPLIED BY LAW WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, RESTRICTED OR MODIFIED NOTWITHSTANDING A CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTION TO THE CONTRARY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AUTODESK AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE, AND LICENSEE RECEIVES, NO WARRANTIES THAT: (I) FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE SDK, LIBRARY AND/OR SAMPLE CODE(S), IF ANY, WILL CONTAIN FEATURES SIMILAR TO OR THE SAME AS THE SDK, LIBRARY AND/OR SAMPLE CODE(S), RESPECTIVELY OR WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE SDK, LIBRARY AND/OR SAMPLE CODE(S), RESPECTIVELY; (II) THE SOFTWARE OR THE SDK, LIBRARY AND/OR SAMPLE CODE(S) WILL MEET LICENSEE REQUIREMENTS; OR (III) OPERATION OF THE SDK, LIBRARY OR SAMPLE CODE(S) WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
6.	Warnings
6.1	Functionality Limitations.  The Licensed Materials and Services (except for Licensed Materials designed for non-commercial use, such as Autodesk Materials designed to be used for household or other consumer purposes or licensed only for purposes of educational or individual learning) are commercial professional tools intended to be used by trained professionals only.  Particularly in the case of commercial professional use, the Licensed Materials and Services are not a substitute for Licensee’s professional judgment or independent testing.  The Licensed Materials and Services are intended only to assist Licensee with its design, analysis, simulation, estimation, testing and/or other activities and are not a substitute for Licensee’s own independent design, analysis, simulation, estimation, testing, and/or other activities, including those with respect to product stress, safety and utility.  Due to the large variety of potential applications for the Licensed Materials and Services, the Licensed Materials and Services have not been tested in all situations under which they may be used.  Autodesk will not be liable in any manner whatsoever for the results obtained through use of the Licensed Materials or Services.  Persons using the Licensed Materials or Services are responsible for the supervision, management, and control of the Licensed Materials and Services and the results of using the Licensed Materials and Services.  This responsibility includes, without limitation, the determination of appropriate uses for the Licensed Materials and Services and the selection of the Licensed Materials, Services and other computer programs and materials to help achieve intended results.  Persons using the Licensed Materials or Services are also responsible for establishing the adequacy of independent procedures for testing the reliability, accuracy, completeness, and other characteristics of any output of the Licensed Materials or Services, including, without limitation, all items designed with the assistance of the Licensed Materials or Services.  Licensee further acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Materials form part of Licensee’s total unique hardware and software environment to deliver specific functionality, and that the Licensed Materials and Services provided by Autodesk may not achieve the results Licensee desires within Licensee’s design, analysis, simulation, estimation, and/or testing constraints.
6.2	Activation Codes and Security.
6.2.1	Activation Code Required for Installation/Access and Continued Use.  Installation of and Access to the Licensed Materials require, and the continued use thereof may from time to time require, activation codes issued by Autodesk.  Registration may be required before an activation code is issued by Autodesk.  Licensee will provide Autodesk and its Reseller with any information required for such registration and agrees that any information provided to Autodesk or its Reseller will be accurate and current.  Licensee will also maintain and update Licensee’s registration information, on an ongoing basis, through customer data registration processes, including without limitation the Customer Information Form, which may be provided by Autodesk.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Autodesk may use such information in accordance with its Privacy Statement (as described or referenced in Section 4 (Privacy; Use of Information; Connectivity)).
6.2.2	Disabling Access.  LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT INSTALLATION OF AND ACCESS TO LICENSED MATERIALS MAY BE DISABLED BY THE ACTIVATION, SECURITY, AND TECHNICAL PROTECTION MECHANISMS IF LICENSEE TRIES TO TRANSFER ALL OR A PART OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS TO ANOTHER COMPUTER, IF LICENSEE TAMPERS WITH THE TECHNICAL PROTECTION MECHANISMS OR DATE-SETTING MECHANISMS ON A COMPUTER OR IN THE LICENSED MATERIALS, IF LICENSEE USES THE LICENSED MATERIALS PAST AN APPLICABLE RELATIONSHIP PROGRAM PERIOD OR FIXED TERM, OR IF LICENSEE UNDERTAKES CERTAIN OTHER ACTIONS THAT AFFECT THE SECURITY MODE OR UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT, IN ANY SUCH EVENT, LICENSEE’S ACCESS TO LICENSEE’S WORK PRODUCT AND OTHER DATA MAY BE AFFECTED.  MORE INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN THE APPLICABLE LICENSED MATERIALS OR AVAILABLE FROM AUTODESK ON REQUEST.
6.2.3	Effect of Activation Codes.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that receipt of an activation code (whether or not provided to Licensee in error) will not constitute evidence of or affect the scope of Licensee’s license rights.  Those rights will be only as set forth in this Agreement and the applicable License Identification.
6.3	Affected Data.  Work product and other data created with Licensed Materials made available under certain License Types, including licenses that limit the permitted purpose to educational purposes or personal learning purposes, may contain certain notices and limitations that make the work product and other data usable only in certain circumstances (e.g., only in the education field).  In addition, if Licensee combines or links work product or other data created with such Licensed Materials with work product or other data otherwise created, then such other work product or data may also be affected by these notices and limitations.  Autodesk will have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if Licensee combines or links work product or other data created with such Licensed Materials with work product or other data otherwise created.  In addition, Licensee will not remove, alter or obscure any such notices or limitations.
7.	Limitations of Liability
7.1	Limitation on Type and Amount of Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL AUTODESK OR ITS SUPPLIERS HAVE ANY LIABILITY (DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY) FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, REVENUE, OR DATA; OR FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION (REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY FOR SEEKING SUCH DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY).  IN ADDITION, THE LIABILITY OF AUTODESK AND ITS SUPPLIERS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY AUTODESK MATERIALS, RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS OR SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY LICENSEE FOR SUCH AUTODESK MATERIALS, RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS, OR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.  
7.2	Application of and Basis for Limitations.  THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 7 (LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY) WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER DERIVED FROM CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF AUTODESK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LIABILITY AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIMITED REMEDIES AVAILABLE HEREUNDER FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  ALSO, LICENSEE AGREES THAT THE LICENSE, RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FEES AND OTHER FEES CHARGED BY AUTODESK AND PAID BY LICENSEE ARE BASED ON AND REFLECTIVE OF THE ALLOCATION OF RISK CONTEMPLATED BY THIS SECTION 7 (LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY) AND THAT THE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 7 (LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY) ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
