# Water Bottle

## FBX2glTF Changes

Imported into Blender, texture files explicitly re-attached to material,
metallic & smoothness separated into distinct textures, smoothness negated
into roughmess, then re-exported as FBX.

## Original Description

Authored with PBR metallic/smoothness intended for import into Unity3D.

Binary FBX contains only the geometry. Textures are in separate files.
